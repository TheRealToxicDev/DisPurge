# DisPurge
Simple bot written in Discord.js to allow better control over Purging Messages in a Discord Server.

When a user purges a message the users name and amount of messages purged are saved to the Bots Database.

This bot is still a **huge** work in progress and I will be adding commands to track users who have purged (etc)
